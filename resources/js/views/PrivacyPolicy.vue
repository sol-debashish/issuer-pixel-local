                <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, or Switzerland, you have
                    certain rights and protections under the law regarding the processing of your personal data, and

                <h4>Legal Basis for Processing</h4>
                <p>When we process your personal data, we will do so in reliance on the following lawful bases:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="mb-2">To perform our responsibilities under our contract with you (e.g., processing
                        payments for and providing the products and services you requested).
                    </li>
                    <li class="mb-2">When we have a legitimate interest in processing your personal data to operate
                        our business or protect our interests (e.g., to provide, maintain, and improve our products and
                        services, conduct data analytics, and communicate with you).
                    </li>
                    <li class="mb-2">To comply with our legal obligations (e.g., to maintain a record of your consents
                        and track those who have opted out of marketing communications).
                    </li>
                    <li class="mb-2">When we have your consent to do so (e.g., when you opt in to receive marketing
                        communications from us). When consent is the legal basis for our processing your personal data,
                        you may withdraw such consent at any time.
                    </li>

                <h4>Data Retention</h4>
                <p>We store the data we collect about you for as long as necessary to carry out the purposes for which
                    we originally collected it and for other legitimate business purposes, including to meet our legal,
                    regulatory, or other compliance obligations.</p>
                <h4>Data Subject Requests</h4>
                <p>Subject to certain limitations, you have the right to request access to the personal data we hold
                    about you and to receive your data in a portable format, the right to ask that your personal data be
