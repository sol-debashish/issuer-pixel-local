                <p>This Agreement is between you and Issuer Pixel Inc. (“Company” or “we” or “us”) concerning your use
                    of
                    (including any access to) the Issuer Pixel platform currently located at www.issuerpixel.com

                <p>THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION THAT, AS FURTHER SET FORTH IN SECTION 18
                    BELOW, REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY

                <p><b>About the Platform:</b> We make the Platform available as a forum where corporations,
                    organizations and
                    other entities (“Entities”) can make and share video and audio materials regarding their businesses
                    with other users of the Platform (“Users”), and where Entities and Users can interact with one
                    another. In particular, Entities may upload audio, video and other content related to their
                    businesses through the Platform (such audio, video and other Entity-uploaded content, “Content”),
                    including on Entity profile pages, and make such Content available to Users. Users can browse the
                    Platform to view Content and can search Content in a customizable manner, including by industry,
                    sectors of interest, country, stage of funding, market capitalization, and for specific Entities.
                    Users and Entities may also make available certain materials through or in connection with the
                    Platform, including on the Platform’s interactive services, such as information sharing, promotional
                    services, message boards and other forums, and chatting, commenting and other messaging
                    functionality (each, a “Submission”). Submissions may include interactions among Entities, among
                    Users and between Entities and Users. The Platform is provided for informational purposes only, and
                    no Content or Submissions made available on the Platform are intended for trading or investing
                    purposes.</p>

                    any
                    reasonable means, including by posting a revised Agreement through the Platform. Any such changes
                    will not apply to any dispute between you and us arising prior to the date on which we posted the

                    Your use of the Platform following any changes to this Agreement will constitute your acceptance of
                    such changes. The “Last Updated” legend above indicates when this Agreement was last changed. We
                    may, at any time and without liability, modify or discontinue all or part of the Platform (including

                    provides
                    recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their
                    rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials available on the

                    e-mail or fax, requesting that Company remove such material or block access to it. If you believe in
                    good faith that someone has wrongly filed a notice of copyright infringement against you, the DMCA
                    permits you to send to Company a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the
                    then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA. See http://www.copyright.gov/ for details.
                    Notices and counter-notices must be sent in writing to Copyright Administrator as follows: By mail
